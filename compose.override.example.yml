      # Mount the whole app in for dev so changes happen instantly. Note,
      # however, that Rails will write a lot of stuff to your host system:
      # log/, tmp/, public/uploads/, even db/schema.rb. You may need this when
      # running rails generators, but otherwise it's not a great idea.

      # NOTE: if you mount this in, files generated by the image definition,
      # such as secret keys, will have to be rebuilt by you manually.
